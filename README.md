# Group Project Premise

In this first assessment, the task was to develop, as a group of two or three, a simple console-mode (no JSP required) object-oriented implementation of HitTastic! using Java.

All input should be done via a simple console interface. You are not required to provide a “pretty” user interface; it just has to be usable. 

# Project Features

You should include the following features. Note that at this stage you must not use a database. You should simply hard-code any data needed by the application (such as songs or users) as Java objects.

The module material from the first four weeks will be sufficient to complete this assessment.

# Group Task Allocation

Group Member A:

a) A user should be able to search for points of interest by location or by type.

b) A user should be able to “like” a point of interest.

c) A user should be able to add a comment on a given point of interest and modify a previous comment.

d) A user should be able to view their previous comments.

As “add a point of interest” is a Group Member C task, Group Member  A should simply hard-code a series of points of interest.

Group Member B:

e) A user should be able to signup for an account.

f) A user should be able to login with a username and password. The system must be able to distinguish between regular users and administrators.

g) An admin user should be able to view a list of all users. 

h) An admin user should be able to change the details of a current user (e.g. name, password) and delete a user.
